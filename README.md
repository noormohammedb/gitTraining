### Agree on a Branching workflow in your team

1. Git allows you to creatr branches - but it doesn't tell you how to use them!
2. You need a written best practice of how work is ideally structured in your team - to avoid mistakes & collisions.
3. It highly depends on your team / team size, on your project, and how you handle releases.
4. It help you to on board new team members.
